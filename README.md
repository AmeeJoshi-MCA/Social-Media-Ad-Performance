# 📊 Meta Ad Performance Dashboard - SQL, Power BI
 ## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains a Power BI Dashboard designed for the comprehensive analysis and optimization of Meta (Facebook & Instagram) advertising campaigns. It transforms raw ad event data, campaign budget information, and user demographics into actionable insights across the entire marketing funnel—from impression to final purchase.

The goal is to provide media buyers and marketing managers with the necessary tools to track performance, assess campaign efficiency, and refine audience targeting.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Track ad performance metrics across multiple Meta platforms.

* Understand engagement trends by gender, age, and country.

* Identify top-performing ad types and campaigns.

* Monitor click-through rate (CTR), engagement rate, and purchase rate.

* Evaluate the impact of ad budgets on overall campaign success.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation

* SQL Server – Data extraction and transformation

* DAX – Calculated KPIs and advanced measures

* Excel/CSV Files – Data source (ad_events, ads, campaigns)

 
## 🧮 Required Data Sources
 The dashboard requires the following four CSV files to be loaded into Power BI. They represent a simplified but complete ad ecosystem:

 | File            | Description                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ad_events.csv` | Contains all user interactions with ads                         |
| `ads.csv`       | Details of each advertisement (platform, ad type, demographics) |
| `campaigns.csv` | Campaign-level data including budgets and status                |
| `users.csv`     | User demographic and interest data for segmentation.            |

## How to Set Up and Run the Dashboard


### Power Bi
 1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash  git clone https://github.com/AmeeJoshi-MCA/Social-Media-Ad-Performance.git```
 
 2. Place Data Files: Ensure the four required .csv files (ad_events.csv, ads.csv, campaigns.csv, users.csv) are placed in the same folder as the .pbix file.

 3. Open the [file](https://github.com/AmeeJoshi-MCA/Social-Media-Ad-Performance/blob/main/PowerBi/SocialMediaAdPerformance.pbit) in Power BI Desktop.

 4. Refresh Data:  If the data doesn't load immediately, go to the Home tab and click Refresh to load the data from the CSV files.
                   (The Power Query steps assume the CSV  files are in the same directory as the PBIX file).

### SQL 

1. Connect to your database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).  
2. Run the SQL scripts in the [`sql/`](https://github.com/AmeeJoshi-MCA/Social-Media-Ad-Performance/blob/main/SQL/SQLQuery1.sql) folder to extract raw data and all kpi queries.


## 🏁 Conclusion

The Meta Ad Performance Dashboard is more than just a data visualization project — it’s a complete analytical solution that showcases my ability to transform complex advertising data into clear, actionable insights.

Through this project, I demonstrated expertise in:

* SQL for data extraction and transformation,

* DAX for advanced KPI calculations,

* Power BI for designing clean, interactive, and user-centric dashboards,

* Strong understanding of digital marketing analytics and business intelligence storytelling.

This project reflects end-to-end data analytics workflow — from building robust SQL queries to creating executive-level dashboards that help marketing teams make data-driven decisions.
